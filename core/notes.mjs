/*
 * Which changed paths still have nothing recorded about them, and which notes
 * already say something about a path.
 *
 * A note is a markdown file under docs/notes whose front matter names, in
 * `covers`, the repository-relative paths the note accounts for. Notes are
 * immutable once written, so a path accumulates notes rather than having one
 * rewritten; any note naming a path is enough to cover it, and a later note
 * that supersedes an earlier one says so in prose for the reader rather than
 * changing what is covered.
 *
 * Everything here fails soft. A note that cannot be read or parsed covers
 * nothing, and an unreadable tree covers nothing at all: the reminder is the
 * only signal there is, so reporting a path as uncovered is always safer than
 * throwing the hook away. Nothing here decides whether a path deserves a note
 * -- that judgment stays with the agent.

 * YAML's spelling of a list: each round closed one hole and left the next.
 * Quoted strings mis-decoded into names the note never wrote; a comma inside a
 * quoted path split it in two; a continuation line ended the list early and
 * kept a prefix of a path as though it were the path. Every one of those
 * silenced a file nobody would ever learn was missed.
